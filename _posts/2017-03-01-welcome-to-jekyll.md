I am a Ph.D. student at the [Educational Technology Collective][etc] (ETC) Lab, University of Michigan School of Information, advised by Dr. [Christopher Brooks][brooksch]. My research focuses on the use of human and machine intelligence to improve Data Science education, in both formal and informal learning settings like MOOCs. Broadly, my work lies at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction,  Data Science and Educational Technology. 

Prior to this, I worked at IBM Research Labs, India. I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT Delhi) in 2017, with a dual Master's + Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computing.
